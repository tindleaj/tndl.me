I have a working notion that there are four main types of written material that we, as human beings, can learn from. I call it the Quaternion Theory, and it is both not a real theory and also a probably incorrect usage of the word 'quaternion'. It applies specifically to types of written resources that we can learn technical truths or facts from, and most of my experience deals with the variety that you can learn something programming-related from, so that's the variety I'll focus on here.

<!-- Primary/Ideal -->

The first class of resource is what I think of as the 'Primary/Ideal' resource. In my mind this is typically a foundational textbook, specification, or research paper, although for facts relating to a specific technology it can also be source code or similar. This resource is the closest to the technical, fundamental truth of a topic. For example, a Primary resource for the Rust programming language could be either the [language reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/), or the [source code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) itself. For a technical concept like Hamming's error detecting and error correcting codes, a Primary resource could be the [original research paper](https://signallake.com/innovation/hamming.pdf), or perhaps a correct implementation of them in an arbitrary programming language.

<!-- Secondary/Auxilliary -->

<!-- Tertiary/Introductory -->

A lot of MOOC courses fall into this classification because they're too easy? (not written)

<!-- Quaternary/Counterproductive -->

Some other notes:

- Some resources straddle the line between primary/secondary resources depending on what the fact is you're concerned with.
